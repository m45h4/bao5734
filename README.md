*Be warned! this is is not your **traditional** finance unit, but more of a financial analytics: modern, sexy and in high demand*

This unit is about how to use financial statement data and non-financial data to understand a company's financial performance, compare it to others and use it for investment decision making.

This unit is a balance between financial unit and data science where we will learn how we can use data to assess drivers of financial performance and predict future financial scenarios. 

We will go through available data science tool so we can use them to dig publicly available data to uncover insights into the company's financial health. 

In particular, we will see how accounting data can be used to estimate corporate strategy, assess risk and predict consumer behaviour. 


We will learn how we can develop predictions and use financial and non-financial data to inform your management decisions (e.g. review strategy, optimise operations or predict outcomes of decisions) as well as investment decisions (e.g. which business to invest)
