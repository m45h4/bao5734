## Tutorial 2. Intro to information presentation and financial sources

### Sources of financial information

To work with data we need to get it `somewhere`. This `somewhere` can be sources internal (e.g. your own customer database or your ERP data) or external (e.g. stock exchange, external supplier, etc.) to your organisation.

1. getting the data from the database

2. uploading data from a local file

3. getting data externally via `API`
